## Advanced Excel Final Project â€“ January 24, 2025

In this final project for my Data Analyst course, I analyzed COVID-19 data (cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations) from 2020 to the present using advanced Excel.
The goal was to provide XYFARMA with a detailed analysis to support their decision on potentially developing a new vaccine.

# Tasks Completed:

1- Collected and cleaned data from official sources using Power Query.

2 -Created pivot tables and pivot charts to visualize the data clearly.

3- Analyzed the Cases/Vaccinations ratio to support strategic decision-making.

4- Prepared a final report with data-driven recommendations.

# Tools Used:

1- Excel (Power Query, PowerPivot, pivot tables and charts)

2- Official national COVID-19 datasets
